# Expressiff blog Overview

Welcome to the blog for Expressif, here the dev team will be leaving their thoughts, ideas, or just some explanation, the obstacles, and here you will be able to see the core, the heart of the beast, as we update this library will highlight pieces of code, sketches or diagrams that help us to conquer our goal.

We love this community, that's why Expressif is open source, we want you to get involved, to help us improve, perhaps report a bug in our [repository](https://github.com/rebelstackio/expressif), or just forked and play with it and if you can improve something you can feel free to create a pull request, connect to our [discord](https://discord.gg/rj4UUErTnj) channel and pitch your ideas.
