### Communication
The Docstrap community is most readily found on its [Discord](https://discord.gg/pRG332)

### Issues
Github is used for tracking issues. The primary location for these is the main [Docstrap repository](https://github.com/rebelstackio/docstrap/issues).
If you’re a Docstrap user, you’re highly encouraged to keep an eye on these issues and jump in on the discussions, to help us understand how to design tradeoffs that might affect you.
